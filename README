Hubble data
===========

The hubble data indicate the distance between Earth and a galaxy, and the speed of each galaxy moving away from Earth.
Here we're interested in the relation between the distance and the recession speed of galaxies.
This relationship was first discovered by Erwin Hubble (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble) in 1929. See the article https://www.pnas.org/content/15/3/168.

In this code, the relation between distance and speed is determined by a linear interpolation, which is first explicity computed by solving the normal equation - providing the exact solution. Then the linear regression of Scikit-learn Python module is adopted, and results are compared with the exact solution.
